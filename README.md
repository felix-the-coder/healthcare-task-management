# 🏥 Healthcare Task Management System Using Fibonacci Heap

The **Healthcare Task Management System** is a robust solution for managing and prioritizing healthcare tasks efficiently. Designed for real-world healthcare environments, the system ensures timely task allocation using advanced data structures and role-based access control, resulting in a **50% reduction in task allocation delays**.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Fibonacci Heap Implementation**:
  - Efficient task prioritization with optimized operations:
    - **Insertion**: \(O(1)\)
    - **Decrease Key**: \(O(1)\)
    - **Extract Min**: \(O(\log n)\)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Secure access for:
    - **Administrators**: Manage tasks and permissions.
    - **Doctors**: Access assigned tasks and patients.
    - **Nurse**: Access assigned tasks.
- **Scalable and Secure**:
  - Supports thousands of tasks with real-time updates.
  - Built using **SQLite** for scalability and data security.
